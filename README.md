# face-detection-opencv
using opencv library in python to detect face in a photograph as well as on a webcam video. we are using haarcascades to detect various features of a human face like the eye, front face, nose etc
you have to make sure that you download all the files and put them in the same folder as your project. if not done so, the code will not be able to read the files which will result in error
make sure that you have installed the opencv library in your IDE (anaconda,pycharm etc). Without this library, "cv2" import will not work and all the functions will eventualy fsil causing errors
